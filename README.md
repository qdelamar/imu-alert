# imu-alert
Chromium addon that alerts you when the visited website uses the IMU sensors of your device.


# why
For more information about what can be done with the data from your sensors see:

In <i>Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Cryptography, Security and Privacy</i> (<i>ICCSP '19</i>). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 81–87.

> Drawing from existing literature, we found that accelerometer data alone may be sufficient to obtain information about a device holder's location, activities, health condition, body features, gender, age, personality traits, and emotional state. Acceleration signals can even be used to uniquely identify a person based on biometric movement patterns and to reconstruct sequences of text entered into a device, including passwords.


# installation
On android you need a chromium-based web browser that supports addons (eg, kiwi).
This also works on desktop chromiums: though you may not have an IMU there, you might be interested in the behavior of the websites you visit.
